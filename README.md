# Ensembler


## Description
This project tries to give users very easy to use and simple functionality to develop code for physical ensembles.

## Contents
### Potential functions

  Contains simple functions, that can be stocked together. 
  Also implementation of new potentials is very easy, as there only few functions that need to be overwritten.
  Examples: Harmonic Oscillator, Wa*ve function, etc.. 
  Also different dimensionalities can be used.

   * OneD

   * TwoD

   * ND

### Systems

   This module is used to setup a simulation. It gets a potential, integrator and other parameters.

### Integrators

   This module provides integrators for integrating potential functions. E.g. Monte Carlo, Velocity Verlet,...

### Visualization

   This module contains predefined visualization a and animation functions.
