Description
-----------

Ensembler is a python package that allows fast and easy access to simulation of one and two-dimensional model systems.
It enables method development using small test systems and to deepen the understanding of a broad spectrum of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, starting from basic techniques to enhanced sampling and free energy calculations.
The ease of installing and using the package increases shareability, comparability, and reproducibility of scientific code developments.
Here, we provide insights into the package's implementation, its usage, and an application example for free energy calculation.

The full Documentation can be found here:  https://rinikerlab.github.io/Ensembler/

Potential functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Implement mathematical functions of interest for modelling purposes for esxample in chemistry.
  Implementation of new potentials is very easy, as there are only few functions that need to be overwritten.
  Implemented Potentials: Harmonic Oscillator, Wave function, etc.. 
  Also different dimensionalities can be used like 1D, 2D, and ND.

  You can try the code in your Browser here (or check out down below the Tutorial&Example section): 

Samplers
^^^^^^^^

   This module provides integrators for integrating potential functions. E.g. Monte Carlo, Velocity Verlet,...

Systems
^^^^^^^

   This module is used to setup a simulation. It gets a potential, integrator and other parameters.

Ensembles
^^^^^^^^^

   This module contains the implementation of the ConveyorBelt and will contain in future additional Replica Exchange approaches.

Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This module contains predefined visualization a and animation functions.

Analysis
^^^^^^^^

   This module contains at the moment only Free Energy Calculations.

How To Install
--------------

Download the git and use the setup.py script of the repository:

.. code-block::

   cd /path/to/local/Ensembler/repo
   pyton setup.py install


Instead of install one could add the path to the Ensembler repository, if you want to use the code and modify it. 
The requirements need then to be installed as well like in the following examples.

   PIP:

.. code-block::

   export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/local/Ensembler/repo
   cd /path/to/local/Ensembler/repo
   pip install -r devtools/pip_requirements/requirements_unix.txt


   Anaconda:

.. code-block::

   conda-develop /path/to/local/Ensembler/repo
   cd /path/to/local/Ensembler/repo
   conda create -n ensembler --file devtools/conda-envs/environment_unix.yml
   conda activate ensembler


For windows, we also provide the requirment files (requirements_unix.txt and environment_windows.yml).

Keep in mind: IDE's have their own awesome ways of doing this.

Tutorials and Examples:
-----------------------

Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^

Here we provide short introductions into how Potential functions can be used and sampled in simulations in Ensembler .
You can try the tutorials with Binder directly from your browser (can take up to 10 minutes to be build)!
