Getting Started
===============
Hello and welcom to Ensembler!
If you want to have a rocket start on the functionality of the package,
we recommend you to use the Binder notebooks, which we provide on our Github page.
There an local environment will be build and you can play with our code on the binder servers.

If you want to test Ensembler locally on your machine, we recommend to follow the Installation and Tutorial guides.

We hope you have fun with Ensembler, because we had!
If you want to contribute to the repository, you are most welcome!

All the Best,
Benjamin Ries
